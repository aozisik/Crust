<h3>Congrats!</h3>

<div class="alert alert-success">Crust Framework 0.9.3 is up and running!</div>
<p>
	
	Well, that was effortless, wasn't it? You have just successfully started using Crust Framework<br />
	to build whatever awesome application you have in mind.
</p>

<b>What is Where:</b>

<ul>
	<li>All config is tucked inside <i>app/config.php</i></li>
	<li>This text is in <i>views/home/index.tpl</i></li>
	<li>All stylesheets, javascripts and images are under <i>public/</i></li> 
	<li>Everything is still under app/bootstrap.php</li>
</ul>


<b>What's New?</b><br />

With Crust 0.9.3, Doctrine is <u>no longer used</u>. Instead we have <b>ActiveRecord</b>, which is absolutely awesome.
<br />
Also Crust 0.9.3 comes packed with <b>Twitter Bootstrap CSS 3</b> and <b>jQuery 1.10</b>
<br /><br />
<p>

<u>Here is a list of other new stuff:</u>

<ul>
	<li>Better routing / mapping</li>
	<li>Tidier working environment</li>
	<li>Built-in error handling</li>
</ul>
